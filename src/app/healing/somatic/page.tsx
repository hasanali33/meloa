            <p>
              Somatic healing focuses on your body as the key to emotional healing. Rather than only talking through experiences,
              this path helps you tune into sensations, patterns, and physical signals that hold stress, trauma, or unprocessed emotion.
              Through modalities like breathwork, body scanning, and intuitive movement, you learn how to release and reset.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Who is this for?</h2>
            <p>
              If you've tried traditional therapy and still feel disconnected or on edge, somatic work can help you ground into your body
              and reclaim your sense of presence. Itâ€™s especially helpful for trauma, anxiety, burnout, and emotional numbness.

            <p>
              A guide might lead you through grounding exercises, breathwork, movement, or gentle touch-based techniques to help you process
              what your body is holding. Youâ€™ll move slowly, intentionally, and always at your own pace.
